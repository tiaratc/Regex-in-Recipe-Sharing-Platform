# Leveraging Regular Expressions (Python) in Recipe Sharing Platforms 


<b>Case Study : Input Validation in Indonesian Recipe Sharing Platforms</b><br>
Indonesia is one of the leading countries with a high number of active social media users. In todayâ€™s digital age, user-generated content is significantly increasing in many online platforms, including recipe websites and apps.
However, many Indonesian recipe sharing platforms face challenges regarding content quality. One factor affecting platform credibility is the inconsistency in formatting and ingredient listings, which can lead to confusion and impacting user satisfaction.<br><br>

<b>Objective</b><br>
To develop a uniform ingredients input in which the measurement units are consistent and the ingredient lists are properly formatted using regular expressions.<br><br>

<b>Implementation</b><br>
Using Python, a validation function for ingredient input is created in the case of recipe sharing platforms in Indonesia. The units used are also based on those commonly used in Indonesia.<br><br>

<b>Results</b><br>
By implementing this regex-based validation, the recipe platform should be able to :<br>
<b>Improved User Experience</b> : users might find the recipes are easier to read and to follow. It will also reduce confusion and errors.<br>
<b>Increased Consistency</b> : recipes could have a uniform format, making user easier to search and compare several recipes.<br>
<b>Enhanced Trust</b> : users would be more likely to trust the platform because user would know the content in this platform has been validated for accuracy and clarity.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
The usage of regular expressions in data validation has the potential to significantly increase the quality of user-submitted recipes. By enforcing specific formats, we can help prevent errors and inconsistencies, which will improve the overall experience on recipe sharing platforms.
